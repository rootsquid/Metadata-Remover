# Metadata-Remover - Created for people who want protect their privacy.
Removes quickly Metadata from any image files per Drag&Drop into ".bat" file.
Creates automatically a folder with the name "Clean" which contains all image files without meta data.
Works together with the imagemagick program and therefore requires an installed version of https://imagemagick.org/index.php

The built-in Windows function under properties also does not seem sufficient.
